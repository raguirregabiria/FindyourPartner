Teachers can add the activity to a course and will be asked to set a name, description, minimum of members, maximum of members, date to close groups, and date to end the activity.

Students can ask to join groups or create one. Students must send a contact method so the members of the group can reach them.

![Autocomplete groups](screenshots/completeGroups.png)

The teacher can close groups before the date to close groups comes. If not the groups will autocomplete when the date to close groups comes.

![Contracts](screenshots/contracts.png)

Once the groups are closed, the students of a group will vote to make contracts. Contracts divide the work in a project and the teacher will be able to see them.
